# A minimalist guide to personal finance

So why yet another finance guide?

This one has embedded tools to visualize and intuit the impact of your actions over time. I find that it's much more visceral this way, and designing it this way maximizes the chance this will make an impact on your life.

## A philosophical digression

Many finance guides and books seem to presuppose that the maximization of money is paramount. All else being equal, it is true that more money is preferable to less money â€” it gives you optionality. But, optionality itself should never be the target.

As a result, I will emphasize that **this guide is not meant for everyone**. This guide is written by a person who has certain opinions. One of these philosophical approach in which money is not the end goal, but rather a mechanism to allow for our flourishing. Dostoevsky's quote describes the fundamental axiom of this work best: "Money is coined freedom."

Money is useful insofar to serve you. However, when the lack of money or the pursuit of money comes at the expense of the things you truly value, that is a problem. Therefore, you need to deeply think about and understand your relationship with money. What people, relationships, and values are most important in your life, and how can money help? What can you already achieve here that you don't need more money for? At what point will you have enough money? What can't you achieve right now due to financial constraints? If you don't fundamentally understand your relationship with money, the best financial advice in the world won't help you.

There's another great phrase "Money is a terrible master but a great servant." For those who are interested, I hope to teach you the foundation for building a system to make your money serve you, and not the other way around.
